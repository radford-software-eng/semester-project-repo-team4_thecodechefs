ROADMAP:
	There are plans to continue development with the app and hopefully getting it published in the app store and working for IOS.
	POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES:
		1.) Better overall layout
		2.) Add more details to the settings/info page
		3.) Add a "Recipe Wheel" to your acccount page that presents a random recipe from your saved recipes to cook.
			 Could be useful for picking between foods to make that day
		4.) Meal planner - Plan out your meals for the week
		5.) To add to the last feature, possibly generating a shopping list by pulling the ingredients
			 from each recipe and generating a final list of ingredients to shop for
		6.) Recipe sharing - users can share recipes with other users and with people outside of the app
		7.) User created recipes - Users can submit their own recipes
		8.) Recipe ranking system - Users can rank a recipe so when others view it, it can help decide if they want to
			 save that recipe
		9.) Better sorting of saved recipes - Users can sort by multiple filters, including difficulty, time, mealtime, etc.
		10.) View new recipes by filter - Users can swipe through new recipes based on filters, including
			 difficulty, time, mealtime, etc.
			For example, a user is specifically looking for a dinner recipe.
		11.) Many more as the development process continues
